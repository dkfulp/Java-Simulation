# Java Simulation

This was a simple simulation for my intro to java class.

In this simulation there are Ameobas and Nematodes in a petri dish. 
For each step in a cycle, the amoebas move to survive and the nematodes try and each them.

The goal of this project was to show the process of keeping track of multiple instances of 
organisms(objects) while taking into account every possible action that they could take.
